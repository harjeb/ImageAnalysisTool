## Current Focus

*   [2025-07-09 22:33:00] - Completed bug fix and visual enhancement for the ROI feature. The application is now stable and provides better visual feedback for ROI selection.

## Recent Changes

*   [2025-07-09 22:33:00] - **Fixed Bug:** Ensured `UpdateProcessedImage()` is called in the `RoiRect` property setter in `MainViewModel.cs` to trigger re-analysis after ROI modification.
*   [2025-07-09 22:33:00] - **Visual Enhancement:** Updated the ROI rectangle in `MainWindow.xaml` to be green with a semi-transparent fill.
*   [2025-07-09 22:33:00] - **Visual Enhancement:** Implemented a custom `RoiAdorner` in `MainWindow.xaml.cs` to draw green corner handles on the ROI, improving usability.
*   [2025-07-09 20:34:29] - Created the complete C++ project structure for the `ImageProcessor` DLL in the `cpp/` directory.
*   [2025-07-09 20:34:29] - Implemented the `ProcessImage_Canny` function using OpenCV.
*   [2025-07-09 20:34:29] - Configured the `.vcxproj` to link against OpenCV.
*   [2025-07-09 20:34:29] - Added `implementation_notes_cpp.md` to the Memory Bank to document C++ specific decisions.
*   Initialized the Memory Bank by creating `productContext.md`.

## Open Questions/Issues

*   The OpenCV path is currently hard-coded in the `.vcxproj` file. This should be addressed with a more flexible solution (e.g., environment variables) in the future.

* [2025-07-09 22:40:41] - **Fixed Bug:** Corrected the logic in `MainWindow.xaml.cs` to ensure `ViewModel.RoiRect` is updated on `MouseUp`, triggering the image analysis.
* [2025-07-09 22:40:41] - **Visual Adjustment:** Changed the ROI rectangle's fill to `Transparent` in `MainWindow.xaml` as per user request.
- **2025-07-09 22:46:57**: The project is now under Git version control. The `main` branch has been pushed to the remote repository at `https://github.com/harjeb/ImageAnalysisTool.git`.
