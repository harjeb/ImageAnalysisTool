# Debugging Log: C# WPF and C++ DLL Integration Issue

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-09

## 1. Initial Problem
- **Symptom:** The C# WPF application (`ImageAnalysisTool.WPF`) failed to run after the C++ DLL (`ImageProcessor.dll`) was successfully compiled.
- **Initial Suspicion:** `DllNotFoundException` or `BadImageFormatException`.

## 2. Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Build Error (`NETSDK1022`)
- **Action:** Attempted to run the application using `dotnet run`.
- **Observation:** The build failed with error `NETSDK1022`, indicating duplicate `<Compile>` items in the `ImageAnalysisTool.WPF.csproj` file.
- **Fix:** Removed the redundant `<ItemGroup>` containing explicit `<Compile>` items from the `.csproj` file, allowing the .NET SDK to handle file inclusion automatically.

### Step 2: DLL Loading Strategy
- **Initial State:** The `DllImport` in `NativeMethods.cs` used a hardcoded, fragile relative path to the DLL in the C++ project's `Debug` output directory. This was incorrect as the DLL was in the `Release` directory.
- **User Feedback:** The user preferred a more robust solution where the DLL is placed in the same directory as the executable.
- **Final Implementation:**
    1.  **Modified `NativeMethods.cs`:** The `DllPath` constant was changed to just the DLL's name (`"ImageProcessor.dll"`). This allows the system to find it in the application's base directory.
    2.  **Modified `.csproj`:** An `AfterTargets="Build"` target was added to the C# project file. This new target automatically copies the `ImageProcessor.dll` from its `Release` build location (`....\cpp\x64\Release\`) to the C# application's output directory (`$(OutDir)`) every time the project is built.

## 3. Final Resolution
The combination of these fixes resulted in a robust and reliable solution.
1.  The build error was fixed by cleaning up the `.csproj` file.
2.  A post-build event was implemented to automatically copy the native DLL to the application's output directory, eliminating pathing issues.
3.  The P/Invoke call was simplified to reference the DLL by name.

The application now compiles, correctly stages its native dependency, and runs successfully.
